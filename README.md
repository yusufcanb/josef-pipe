## Motivation

This project aims to be a boilerplate to ship Jenkins platform to an on-premise environment with pre-configured and pre-installed pipelines using Docker.     

**Where does the name come from?**

It was inspired by the name of a PVC pipe brand (FÄ±rat Boru), which is quite viral in Turkey.
